# Tasks completed to explore the database and extract meaningful insights

``` 1. Get to know our data: Before we do anything else, let's take a good look at our data. We'll load up the database and pull up the first few records from each table. It's like getting to know a new city- we need to explore the lay of the land before we can start our journey.

2. Dive into the water sources: We've got a whole table dedicated to the types of water sources in our database. Let's dig into it and figure out all the unique types of water sources we're dealing with.

3. Unpack the visits to water sources: The 'visits' table in our database is like a logbook of all the trips made to different water sources. We need to unravel this logbook to understand the frequency and distribution of these visits. Let's identify which locations have been visited more than a certain number of times.

4. Assess the quality of water sources: The quality of water sources is a pretty big deal. We'll turn to the water_quality table to find records where the subjective_quality_score is within a certain range and the visit_count is above a certain threshold. This should help us spot the water sources that are frequently visited and have a decent quality score.

5. Investigate any pollution issues: We can't overlook the pollution status of our water sources. Let's find those water sources where the pollution_tests result came back as 'dirty' or 'biologically contaminated'. This will help us flag the areas that need immediate attention.
